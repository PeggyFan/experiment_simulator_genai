# 🧪 Product Spec: Experimentation Simulator for GenAI Features

---

## 1. Overview / Summary

**One-liner:**  
A simulator that helps AI PMs and operators visualize and compare GenAI feature performance under different experimentation strategies (A/B testing, bandits, Bayesian updates).

**Purpose:**  
Enable better decision-making for launching GenAI features by letting teams *simulate trade-offs in performance, cost, and confidence* without deploying real experiments.

---

## 2. Why GenAI Experimentation Is Different

GenAI features fundamentally change how we think about experimentation.  
Unlike normal product features — which behave deterministically and are easy to measure — GenAI systems are *probabilistic*, *subjective*, and *costly* to evaluate.

| Aspect | Traditional Feature Testing | **GenAI Feature Testing** |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Output type** | Deterministic and consistent | Probabilistic and variable |
| **Metric clarity** | Objective metrics (CTR, conversion) | Subjective metrics (helpfulness, tone, hallucination) |
| **Experiment noise** | Low variance | High variance, even for same input |
| **Evaluation** | Automated, cheap | LLM-based or human, costly |
| **Cost per sample** | Negligible | Token-based ($/call), latency-based |
| **Decision type** | Binary ("A wins") | Multi-objective ("better + faster + cheaper") |


**Implications for PMs and Operators:**
- Experiments must consider **uncertainty, noise, and subjective judgment**.  
- Each “sample” costs real money and time (token + latency cost).  
- Evaluation itself can be noisy — **LLM evaluators vs human raters** trade off cost vs accuracy.  
- Decisions are not purely statistical; they’re **strategic and multidimensional**.

**Therefore:**  
The Experimentation Simulator helps PMs *see* these trade-offs — visualizing how cost, evaluation type, and uncertainty influence their launch decisions.

## 3. Problem Statement

**Context:**  
In traditional software, A/B tests are deterministic — you can easily measure clicks, conversions, etc.  
In GenAI features, outcomes (e.g., “quality of generated text”) are **noisy, probabilistic, and expensive** to evaluate.  

**Core Problems:**
1. Experiments are costly to run on live traffic.  
2. PMs often don’t understand trade-offs between sample size, confidence, and iteration speed.  
3. GenAI introduces new metrics (e.g., “helpfulness,” “hallucination rate”) that aren’t binary.  
4. Evaluation may be automated (LLM-based) or human-rated, adding variability and cost.

**Opportunity:**  
A simulation tool can teach and support decision-making *before* launch — reducing wasted cost, improving intuition, and enabling faster iteration.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|
| Oversimplified simulation misrepresents real-world GenAI dynamics | Use realistic noise distributions, and allow user-adjustable parameters |
| PM Summary feels too “canned” | Use simple templating or a real LLM to generate natural-sounding rationale |
| Cost model complexity | Start with token-based linear model; add latency later |
| Too technical for PM audience | Focus on visualization and plain-language interpretation |

## Experiment Simulator Inputs

### 1️⃣ True Mean & Standard Deviation per Variant

In the simulator, each variant requires a **true mean (`μ`)** and **standard deviation (`σ`)** for the metric being evaluated. These values are used to generate synthetic data for each variant.

**How to determine `μ` and `σ`:**

- **Historical Data**

```python
import numpy as np

baseline_values = np.array([100, 105, 98, 102, 110])
mu_baseline = np.mean(baseline_values)
sigma_baseline = np.std(baseline_values)
# If variant B expected to increase by 5%
mu_B = mu_baseline * 1.05
sigma_B = sigma_baseline  # or adjust proportionally
```

#### Pilot / Small-Scale Test
* Run a small pre-experiment to empirically estimate mean and std.

#### Analytical / Parametric Assumptions
* Use a known distribution, e.g., CTR ~ Binomial(n_trials, p_true).

Notes: 
1. In real experiments, true mean and std are unknown. In the simulator, these are assumptions or estimates.

### 2️⃣ Evaluator Bias per Variant

Each evaluator may systematically over- or under-rate a variant.
This is how one can estimate it:

#### Collect repeated measurements
* Have each evaluator rate multiple items from each variant. 
* Compute the average difference between evaluator rating and true metric:
```
evaluator_bias = np.mean(evaluator_ratings - true_values)
observed_rating = true_value + bias_evaluator + random_noise
```
#### Statistical modeling
* Model each evaluator as:

   * \text{observed_rating} = \text{true_value} + \text{bias}_e + \epsilon

   * bias_e is the evaluator’s systematic bias

   * ε is random noise

Fit a simple linear model or mixed-effects model to estimate bias_e per evaluator.
* bias_evaluator is systematic bias

* random_noise captures variability

* Control Items / Gold Standard
* Compare evaluator ratings to known true values to compute bias.

#### Use control items / gold standards
* Include items with known true values in the evaluation set.
* Compare evaluator responses to these known values to estimate bias.

#### Simulate biases
* If you don’t have real evaluators yet, you can assign biases artificially for the simulation:

```
evaluator_biases = {"Alice": 2.0, "Bob": -1.5, "Charlie": 0.0}
simulated_rating = true_value + evaluator_biases[evaluator_name] + np.random.normal(0, sigma_noise)
```

Notes: 
1. Bias is systematic, noise is random.
2. For simulation, you can vary bias and noise to test robustness of analysis.
3. In real experiments, bias estimation requires some form of ground truth or repeated measures.

## 12. Demo & Storytelling Plan

1. Introduce the problem: “Why GenAI experimentation is different.”  
2. Run a live simulation (A/B vs bandit).  
3. Toggle between **LLM** and **human evaluation modes** — show noise differences.  
4. Show cost impact (e.g., token cost per variant).  
5. Display the **PM Summary Report**:  
   > “Variant B shows higher mean helpfulness (+0.07) with 95% confidence.  
   > Estimated cost per evaluation: $0.002.  
   > Recommend collecting 1,000 more samples to confirm superiority.”  
6. End with a brief operator/PM reflection on decision trade-offs.
