# 🧪 Product Spec: Experimentation Simulator for GenAI Features

---

## 1. Overview / Summary

**One-liner:**  
A simulator that helps AI PMs and operators visualize and compare GenAI feature performance under different experimentation strategies (A/B testing, bandits, Bayesian updates).

**Purpose:**  
Enable better decision-making for launching GenAI features by letting teams *simulate trade-offs in performance, cost, and confidence* without deploying real experiments.

---

## 2. Why GenAI Experimentation Is Different

GenAI features fundamentally change how we think about experimentation.  
Unlike normal product features — which behave deterministically and are easy to measure — GenAI systems are *probabilistic*, *subjective*, and *costly* to evaluate.

| Aspect | Traditional Feature Testing | **GenAI Feature Testing** |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Output type** | Deterministic and consistent | Probabilistic and variable |
| **Metric clarity** | Objective metrics (CTR, conversion) | Subjective metrics (helpfulness, tone, hallucination) |
| **Experiment noise** | Low variance | High variance, even for same input |
| **Evaluation** | Automated, cheap | LLM-based or human, costly |
| **Cost per sample** | Negligible | Token-based ($/call), latency-based |
| **Decision type** | Binary ("A wins") | Multi-objective ("better + faster + cheaper") |
| **Risk profile** | UX regression | Factual, ethical, or bias errors |

**Implications for PMs and Operators:**
- Experiments must consider **uncertainty, noise, and subjective judgment**.  
- Each “sample” costs real money and time (token + latency cost).  
- Evaluation itself can be noisy — **LLM evaluators vs human raters** trade off cost vs accuracy.  
- Decisions are not purely statistical; they’re **strategic and multidimensional**.

**Therefore:**  
The Experimentation Simulator helps PMs *see* these trade-offs — visualizing how cost, evaluation type, and uncertainty influence their launch decisions.

## 3. Problem Statement

**Context:**  
In traditional software, A/B tests are deterministic — you can easily measure clicks, conversions, etc.  
In GenAI features, outcomes (e.g., “quality of generated text”) are **noisy, probabilistic, and expensive** to evaluate.  

**Core Problems:**
1. Experiments are costly to run on live traffic.  
2. PMs often don’t understand trade-offs between sample size, confidence, and iteration speed.  
3. GenAI introduces new metrics (e.g., “helpfulness,” “hallucination rate”) that aren’t binary.  
4. Evaluation may be automated (LLM-based) or human-rated, adding variability and cost.

**Opportunity:**  
A simulation tool can teach and support decision-making *before* launch — reducing wasted cost, improving intuition, and enabling faster iteration.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|
| Oversimplified simulation misrepresents real-world GenAI dynamics | Use realistic noise distributions, and allow user-adjustable parameters |
| PM Summary feels too “canned” | Use simple templating or a real LLM to generate natural-sounding rationale |
| Cost model complexity | Start with token-based linear model; add latency later |
| Too technical for PM audience | Focus on visualization and plain-language interpretation |

## 12. Demo & Storytelling Plan

1. Introduce the problem: “Why GenAI experimentation is different.”  
2. Run a live simulation (A/B vs bandit).  
3. Toggle between **LLM** and **human evaluation modes** — show noise differences.  
4. Show cost impact (e.g., token cost per variant).  
5. Display the **PM Summary Report**:  
   > “Variant B shows higher mean helpfulness (+0.07) with 95% confidence.  
   > Estimated cost per evaluation: $0.002.  
   > Recommend collecting 1,000 more samples to confirm superiority.”  
6. End with a brief operator/PM reflection on decision trade-offs.
